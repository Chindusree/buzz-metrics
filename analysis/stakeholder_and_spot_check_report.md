## TASK 2: LOW SCORER BREAKDOWN + SPOT CHECKS

### Low Scorers (0-20) Statistics

**Total articles in 0-20 band:** 96

| Source Count | Articles | Percentage |

### SPOT CHECK #1: Zero Sources Category

**Headline:** Bournemouth Boxer Set for Return After Year Away
- **URL:** https://buzz.bournemouth.ac.uk/2026/01/bournemouth-boxer-set-for-return-after-year-away/
- **SEI Score:** 0.0
- **Quoted Sources:** 0
- **SEI Components:**
  - Inclusion: 0.0
  - Structural Agency: 0.0
  - Impact Equity: 0.0
  - Ghost Ratio: 1.00 (all stakeholders missing)

**First 300 words:**
> A Bournemouth boxer has announced his first fight back since falling short in a title challenge last year. Charminster's Mace Ruegg confirmed via social media that he is set to return to the ring in Liverpool on March 8th, marking a significant step in the next phase of his professional career. By the time fight night arrives, it will have been exactly one year and seven days since Ruegg last stepped through the ropes. His previous outing came at the Bournemouth International Centre (BIC), where he challenged for the Commonwealth Silver lightweight title in front of a home crowd. Mace Ruegg pictured centre. (Credit: Benji Sampson) That bout saw Ruegg face seasoned campaigner Liam Dillon on the high-profile "Collision on the Coast" card, promoted by Hall of Fame promoter Frank Warren and Queensbury Promotions. Despite a strong performance, Ruegg narrowly missed out on the belt, losing via split decision in what proved to be the first defeat of his professional career. Heading into that contest undefeated, the Bournemouth fighter now faces the challenge of rebuilding momentum after a lengthy spell away from competition. A year out of the ring can often lead to concerns over sharpness and timing, but Ruegg will be hoping his return fight provides an opportunity to shake off any ring rust and reassert himself in the lightweight division. Since his last appearance, Ruegg has also undergone a significant change behind the scenes. He has moved away from Poole-based trainer Steve Bendall, who had worked closely with Ruegg alongside his father, Danny Ruegg, throughout much of his career. Ruegg has now linked up with Ian Weaver, joining a growing stable of South Coast fighters that includes Morgan Selemuthu and Lloyd Farrington. Weaver brings a wealth of experience to the partnership, having enjoyed a successful amateur career of...

**Manual Assessment:** Pure announcement article. No interviews conducted. Boxer himself could have been contacted for quotes about his return. Trainer Ian Weaver also could have provided insight. Lazy journalism.

### SPOT CHECK #2: Zero Sources Category

**Headline:** Dorchester Town in search of away win at Havant
- **URL:** https://buzz.bournemouth.ac.uk/2026/01/dorchester-town-in-search-of-away-win-at-havant/
- **SEI Score:** 0.0
- **Quoted Sources:** 0
- **SEI Components:**
  - Inclusion: 0.0
  - Structural Agency: 0.0
  - Impact Equity: 0.0
  - Ghost Ratio: 1.00

**First 300 words:**
> Dorchester make the midweek trip to Hampshire, and are looking to shake their winless run of 5 games against a Havant team who have won 5 of their last 6, in the Southern League Premier South. The Magpies look to potentially jump out of the relegation zone with a win away from home, if results go their way. The club also have games in hand on those who are only just above the relegation zone, such as three games in hand on local rivals Weymouth, who sit two points above Dorchester, and one point above safety. Tom Killick, Dorchester boss, will be hoping that the short trip can act as a springboard to create a turnaround in fortunes for his side, who are winless in the league since early December, with no away win since October. However, Killick will be aware of how challenging the tip will be, as Havant have beaten three of the league's top six in their last six matches. After a chaotic end to their 2-2 draw away at Taunton, the club will look to build on Ryan Seager's' 96th minute equaliser, who looks to continue his good run of goal scoring form, having scored 4 in his last 4. Havant look to chase play offs with a win, as they look to start to close the 11 point gap this evening. The Hawks are set comfortably in mid table of the Southern League Premier South after what some would describe a surprisingly slow start in the league for a side that only narrowly missed out on the final spot of the play offs last season. In the previous meeting, both sides' end of season hopes were linked as both clubs looked to battle it out for the league's last play off spot. The two clubs...

**Manual Assessment:** Match preview with pure stats/standings analysis. Manager Tom Killick is mentioned but not quoted. Ryan Seager (player in form) not contacted. Standard "preview from a distance" journalism with no actual reporting.

### SPOT CHECK #3: One Source Category

**Headline:** GB Tennis star misses out on deaf Olympics
- **URL:** https://buzz.bournemouth.ac.uk/2026/01/gb-tennis-star-misses-out-on-deaf-olympics/
- **SEI Score:** 17.5
- **Quoted Sources:** 1
  - Ethan Carter (M, IMPACT) - the athlete himself
- **SEI Components:**
  - Inclusion: 0.0 (0% non-male)
  - Structural Agency: 0.0 (no structural sources)
  - Impact Equity: 25.0 (1 impact source)
  - Ghost Ratio: 0.75 (3 of 4 stakeholder groups missing)

**First 300 words:**
> Ethan Carter is back on court and rebuilding momentum after a frustrating six-month injury layoff that denied him the chance to represent Team GB at the Deaf Olympics in Tokyo. The 18-year-old from Winchester, who trains at Swanmore Tennis Club, is regarded as one of Britain's brightest deaf tennis prospects. Carter has previously reached a career-high world ranking of 36 and is currently ranked 50th globally, while sitting third in Great Britain. However, a recurring hip injury struck at a crucial point in his development, preventing him from competing consistently and playing a key role in his absence from the Games. Carter said: "It's an injury I've dealt with before, but when it came back it meant I couldn't perform at my best level. It was very frustrating not being able to compete in the deaf olympics but It's just a part of the game." The setback forced Carter to step away from regular competition, but his focus has remained firmly on recovery. Regular physiotherapy and structured gym work have underpinned his rehabilitation, and he has now returned to consistent on-court training as he looks to regain form and confidence. Despite his age, Carter already has an impressive CV. He has won a Deaf international doubles tournament and claimed the national deaf singles title, one of the standout achievements of his career. He has also represented Great Britain internationally, competing in Germany and Austria, as well as featuring in the deaf equivalent of the Davis Cup. Carter said: "I started travelling to tournaments abroad when I was 15, representing Great Britain in the deaf equivalent of the Davis Cup is one of my proudest achievements". Funding remains a challenge, as it is for many athletes in disability sport, with financial limitations restricting the number of tournaments he has been able...

**Manual Assessment:** Single-source feature. Good athlete access, but missing:
- Medical perspective (physiotherapist, sports injury specialist)
- Team GB deaf tennis coaching/management perspective
- Funding body perspective on disability sport support

Could have been a much richer story with 2-3 additional voices.

## KEY FINDINGS

### Top Scorers (Task 1)
1. All legitimate high scores - no gaming detected
2. All featured 100% or 75% non-male sourcing
3. Proper balance of STRUCTURAL and IMPACT sources
4. Appropriate ghost stakeholder identification (1-2 groups per article)
5. Strong performance on gendered topics (cervical cancer, gender-based violence)

### Low Scorers (Task 2)
1. **76% have 0-1 sources** - primary issue is lack of sourcing, not just gender
2. Zero-source articles are pure announcement/preview journalism
3. Single-source articles miss obvious additional stakeholders
4. Even 2-source low scorers lack STRUCTURAL voices (experts/officials)
5. Sports heavily represented in low scorers (match previews, athlete profiles)

### Production Issues
- 2 articles (#4 and #5 in spot check) have incomplete content on website
- These should be flagged for editorial review

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Editorial Standards:** Set minimum sourcing requirement (2+ sources for all stories)
2. **Sports Coverage:** Address sports desk's reliance on single-source/no-source pieces
3. **Expert Sourcing:** Encourage reporters to include STRUCTURAL sources (experts, officials) alongside IMPACT sources
4. **Website QA:** Investigate incomplete articles and establish content verification process
