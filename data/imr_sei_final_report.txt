  ✗ Article #12 discrepancy:
    - Groq: 0 sources
    - Claude: 1 source (Dr Jefferies - forensic analyst quote found)
    - Assessment: Potential Groq extraction error

    - STRUCTURAL: Police spokespeople, forensic experts, transfer journalists

STORY TYPE CLASSIFICATION: 95.7% agreement (22/23)
  ✓ Perfect match on 22 articles
  ✗ Article #13 discrepancy:
    - Groq: STANDARD
    - Claude: EXPERIENTIAL
    - Article: "Why young people should join orchestra" (feature with musicians)

    - Groq: 4/4 stakeholders ghosted
    - Claude: 3/4 stakeholders ghosted
    - Likely counted Rayan's family differently

================================================================================
CORE FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. EXCELLENT SOURCE EXTRACTION RELIABILITY
   - 98.3% agreement on source identification and role classification
   - Only 1 extraction error found (Article #12 - Groq missed quote)
   - Gender and role classification: 100% agreement

2. EXEMPTION RULES ARE PRIMARY DISAGREEMENT
   - 7 vs 3 articles exempted (Claude stricter on previews/live content)
   - Need policy clarification on:
     * Match previews vs profiles (Article #29 has rich manager quotes)
     * Live bulletins vs press conference reports (#27)
     * Rain-interrupted matches (#20)

3. BEAT GENDERED CLASSIFICATION SHOWS VARIANCE
   - 78% agreement (lowest of all metrics)
   - Inconsistency in classifying:
     * Women's sports as gendered beat
     * Men's sports transfer news as gendered beat
     * Match postponements as gendered beat

4. HIGH AGREEMENT ON COMPLEX JUDGMENTS
   - STRUCTURAL vs IMPACT: 100% agreement
   - Story type (STANDARD vs EXPERIENTIAL): 96% agreement
   - Both models correctly distinguished:
     * Organizational insiders (IMPACT) from external experts (STRUCTURAL)
     * Participants in events (IMPACT) from authority figures (STRUCTURAL)

5. ONE POTENTIAL MODEL A ERROR
   - Article #12: Groq reported 0 sources but listed Dr Jefferies in stakeholders
   - Claude found quote: "the knife wound caused the damage..."
   - Suggests Groq extraction logic may have skipped this source

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE: Review Article #12 in Groq baseline
   - Verify Dr Jefferies quote extraction
   - Check for systematic issues with forensic expert quotes

2. POLICY: Clarify SEI exemption rules
   - Match previews: Exempt if no substantive quotes, or always exempt?
   - Article #29 has rich manager interview - should it be scored?
   - Live bulletins: Exempt if "LIVE" in headline, or only if no analysis?

3. METHODOLOGY: Align beat gendered classification
   - Create explicit rules for:
     * Women's sports events (gendered or neutral?)
     * Men's sports transfer news (gendered or neutral?)
     * Administrative sports news (postponements, draws)

4. VALIDATION: Consider Article #13 story type
   - Orchestra feature with rich musician narratives
   - Groq=STANDARD, Claude=EXPERIENTIAL
   - Borderline case worth discussing for criteria refinement

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

✓ SEI EXTRACTION IS HIGHLY RELIABLE
  - 98% agreement on core source identification and role classification
  - 100% agreement on gender and STRUCTURAL/IMPACT roles
  - Models demonstrate strong inter-rater reliability on complex judgments

✗ EXEMPTION RULES NEED CLARIFICATION
  - 5 articles show disagreement on what should be exempt
  - Current rules may be too strict (Claude) or too lenient (Groq)

✓ IMR VALIDATES PRODUCTION SYSTEM
  - With exemption rules clarified, SEI scoring is reproducible
  - Only 1 potential extraction error found in 30 articles
  - High confidence in STRUCTURAL/IMPACT role classifications

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: SEI methodology shows strong inter-model reliability
with minor policy clarifications needed for exemption rules.
