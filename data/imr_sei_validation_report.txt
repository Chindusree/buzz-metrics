================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. OVERALL RELIABILITY: 84.5%
   - Strong inter-model agreement across most components
   - 61.3% of articles achieved perfect agreement on all components

2. FLAGGED COMPONENTS (below 80% threshold):

   A. Ghost/Absent Perspectives (64.5% agreement)
      - Most problematic component
      - 11 disagreements across 11 articles
      - Systematic bias: Claude consistently reports FEWER absent perspectives
      - Suggests different stakeholder identification methodologies

   B. S-Gender/Structural Source Gender (78.6% agreement)
      - 3 disagreements (articles 44, 46, 48)
      - Pattern: Claude identifies 0 non-male structural sources where Groq found 1-2
      - Affects crime/policy reporting articles specifically

3. HIGH-AGREEMENT COMPONENTS (>85%):
   - Gender identification: 96.4%
   - I-Gender (Impact source gender): 90.5%
   - Source Count: 90.3%
   - Structural source identification: 87.1%
   - Impact source identification: 83.9%

4. ARTICLES WITH MULTIPLE DISAGREEMENTS:
   - Article 44 (E-bike murder): 5 disagreements

   - Article 48 (Pubs support): 4 disagreements
   - Article 43 (Vince contract): 3 disagreements
   - Article 41 (Starmer China): 3 disagreements
   
   Pattern: Crime/policy articles with complex source structures

================================================================================
VALIDATION OUTCOME
================================================================================

✓ PASSED: Overall IMR of 84.5% demonstrates strong inter-model reliability
⚠ ATTENTION REQUIRED: Ghost/Absent Perspectives component needs methodology review
⚠ ATTENTION REQUIRED: S-Gender identification in crime/policy contexts

RECOMMENDATION:
- SEI metric is reliable for source counting and gender identification
- Absent perspectives (Ghost) component requires standardization between models
- Consider additional validation for articles with 5+ sources
